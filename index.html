          <h2>HTML</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the webpage.</li>
            <li>As developers, one of the first things we must think about when developing a webpage is building a sturdy "frame" using HTML.</li>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage, or <b>metadata</b>,that helps the browser to render the page correctly. Elements included in the header are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
            <li>The body and head elements are examples of a semantic HTML element. In <b>semantic HTML elements</b>, the name of the element describes the content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
            <li>Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common to see non-semantic elements such as <b>div</b> to create a division in the page, or <b>span</b> to create an inline division. Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve.</li> 
            <li>The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible, especially when the content is visible to users.</li>
